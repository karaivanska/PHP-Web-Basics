Write a program that modifies a number until the average value of
all of its digits is higher than 5. In order to modify the number,
your program should append a 9 to the end of the number, when the
average value of all of its digits is higher than 5 the program
should stop appending. If the numberâ€™s average value of all of its
digits is already higher than 5, no appending should be done.
The input is a single number received as a string. The output
should consist of a single number - the final modified number which
has an average value of all of its digits higher than 5. The output
should be printed on the console.
